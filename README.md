**Target Audience**: Students, professionals, anyone who needs to keep track of tasks

**Functional Requirements**

**Create tasks**: Users should be able to create new tasks with descriptions, due dates, and priorities.

**Edit tasks**: Users should be able to edit existing tasks, including their descriptions, due dates, and priorities.

**Delete tasks**: Users should be able to delete tasks that are no longer needed.

**Set due dates**: Users should be able to set due dates for tasks. The app should be able to remind users of upcoming deadlines.

**Prioritize tasks**: Users should be able to prioritize tasks based on their importance. The app should display tasks in order of priority.

**Track progress**: Users should be able to track their progress on tasks by marking them as completed or in progress.

**Search for tasks**: Users should be able to search for tasks by name, description, or due date.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

**Usability**: The app should be easy to use and navigate for users of all skill levels.

**Performance**: The app should be fast and responsive, even when dealing with large amounts of data.

**Reliability**: The app should be reliable and should not crash or freeze.

**Scalability**: The app should be able to scale to accommodate a large number of users and tasks.
 
## 10.IDE
I use generally Viual Studio for project development. Some extensions are very usefull which are very useful during   
development such as "Regex Previewer", "Live Server", "VS Code Counter" however not all of these were used   
during this project

-Ctrl+/      : Comment selected or current line    
-Alt+Up      : Move up line      
-Alt+Down    : Move down line    
-F5          : Debug   
-Shift+F5    : Stop debug  
-Alt+Left Click    :to add cursor multiple places in code (Especially very usefull when you need to correct a TYPO)  
-Hold down Scoll button and move     : Similar to Alt+Left Click, select a part of multiple lines and adds cursor to each line  
-Shift+Arrow buttons  : Select a part of line or whole multiple lines  
-Ctrl+Arrow buttons   : Jump over the whole word   
-Ctrl+Backspace       : Delete the whole word  
these are most used shortcuts for me.  
And of course   
-Ctrl+C   
-Ctrl+V to copy and paste
