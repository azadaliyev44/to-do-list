## 10.IDE
I use generally Viual Studio for project development. Some extensions are very usefull which are very useful during   
development such as "Regex Previewer", "Live Server", "VS Code Counter" however not all of these were used   
during this project

-Ctrl+/      : Comment selected or current line    
-Alt+Up    : Move up line      
-Alt+Down  : Move down line    
-F5          : Debug   
-Shift+F5  : Stop debug  
-Alt+Left Click :to add cursor multiple places in code (Especially very usefull when you need to correct a TYPO)  
-Hold down Scoll button and move : Similar to Alt+Left Click, select a part of multiple lines and adds cursor to each line  
-Shift+Arrow buttons : Select a part of line or whole multiple lines  
-Ctrl+Arrow buttons : Jump over the whole word 
-Ctrl+Backspace : Delete the whole word  
these are most used shortcuts for me.  
And of course   
-Ctrl+C   
-Ctrl+V to copy and paste
