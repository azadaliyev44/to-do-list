**B.Analysis of To-Do List App**

1. Defining the Problem 

The main problem to be mentioned is the difficulty of managing tasks and deadlines efficiently and in the right order, So, many people have difficulties while keeping track of their tasks, which can lead to missed deadlines, forgotten tasks and stress. A to-do list app can help to solve this problem by providing a centralized manging point for tasks, reminders.

2. Market analysis

The To-do list app market is hard to estimate a worth for it, it can be as high as you can imagine, because of a growing demand for innovative and user-friendly solutions. The market is expected to continue expanding in the coming years as it has been growing for years, driven by increasing smartphone usage and the growing need for effective task management tools.

3. Business Model and Profit

A freemium business model can be best option to make profit form this project, it is offering a basic version of the app for free and providing premium features with in-app purchases. This approach will allow us to reach a wider audience as it is free while monetizing our app effectively with users who wants to use premium features. Placing ads may not be best option because ads can be annoying sometimes so it can lead a bad reputation for our project

4. Development

The development of our To-do list app is being developed by a team of experienced software developers who are expert in using effective methods of development. Our focus is on making sure that the app is scalable, secure,user friendly for all ages, and integrates with other productivity tools.

5. Competitive Analysis

Of course there are some existing to-do list apps in the market, such as Todoist, Wunderlist, and Evernote. These apps have a variety of features. Like feature to create lists, set reminders, and sync across your devices, but there is still room for new features in the to-do list app market, for example, many current apps lack the feature to prioritize tasks, track your time spent on each tasks, or collaborate with others on tasks and make changes on the current situation of the task.

6. Target Audience

Our To-Do List app targets a wide range of users, such as students, professionals, teachers or even individuals who wants to improve their own productivity. Our app will provide service to a wide range of tasks, from personal tasks to work-related projects, from creative tasks to personal goals.
As our app have unique features which others do not have:  
**I Integrations**: Our application integrates other productivity tools, such as calendars apps, email apps, and note-taking apps, giving a centralized experience for managing tasks and duties.  
**II Task Management**: This to-do app offers better task management features, which create possibilites for users to customize their path of work, set reminders, prioritize their tasks,caategorize their tasks, and keep the track of progress.  
**III AI Assistant**: This to-do app comes with an AI that actively suggests tasks based on current tasks, makes reminders, and offers to the user personalized recommendations based on their behavior.

## 10.IDE
I use generally Viual Studio for project development. Some extensions are very usefull which are very useful during   
development such as "Regex Previewer", "Live Server", "VS Code Counter" however not all of these were used   
during this project

-Ctrl+/      : Comment selected or current line    
-Alt+Up      : Move up line      
-Alt+Down    : Move down line    
-F5          : Debug   
-Shift+F5    : Stop debug  
-Alt+Left Click    :to add cursor multiple places in code (Especially very usefull when you need to correct a TYPO)  
-Hold down Scoll button and move     : Similar to Alt+Left Click, select a part of multiple lines and adds cursor to each line  
-Shift+Arrow buttons  : Select a part of line or whole multiple lines  
-Ctrl+Arrow buttons   : Jump over the whole word   
-Ctrl+Backspace       : Delete the whole word  
these are most used shortcuts for me.  
And of course   
-Ctrl+C   
-Ctrl+V to copy and paste
