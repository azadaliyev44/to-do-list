## 10.IDE
I used Viual Studio for project development.

Ctrl+/      - Comment selected or current line    
Alt + Up    - Move up line      
Alt + Down  - Move down line    
F5          - Debug   
Shift + F5  - Stop debug  
these are most used shortcuts for me.

fulfilled tasks can be removed form main list and stored in archive. Tasks can contain subtasks and the main task
